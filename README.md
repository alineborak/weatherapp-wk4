WHAT IS THIS ABOUT?

Create a weather app similar to google weather.

1. Include the JavaScript file provided in your project, when loading your project, ask the user "Enter a city" (example: Paris), alert "It is currently 19°C (66°F) in Paris with a humidity of 80%"

2. If the city doesn't exist in the object (i.e: Sydney), alert "Sorry, we don't know the weather for this city, try going to https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+sydney". Since this is an alert, the link shouldn't be clickable.

Add this behavior to your project and submit the CodeSandbox URL

Note: Please round the values in the Alert to the nearest whole number (no decimal points, e.g. 5.45 should be rounded to 5).
